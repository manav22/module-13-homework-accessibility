# Module 13 Homework: Accessibility

This repository contains a React Native application. It uses Expo Go to run the app so you don't have to do a full native build to run it.

```bash
yarn start # To get metro started
```

Once you get metro running, you can either tap on `a` to run the app on an Android emulator or `i` to run the app on an iOS simulator.
Or if you have a real device, you can scan the QR code to run the app on your device.

The real goal of this homework is to successfully order some food from the app by only using the screen reader. Make sure to close your eyes!
You will notice that the app is missing some accessibility features such as accessibility states.
Once you go through the order process, try thinking about what you can do to make the app more accessible. Implement those changes, test them out and then check out the [hints](./HINTS.md) to see a list of possible improvements.

Once you are done, you can check the [solution branch](https://github.com/callstack-workshops/abbott-module-13-homework-accessibility/tree/solution) to see how I implemented the changes.

Also once you are done, please go through the order process again to see how it improved the experience.
